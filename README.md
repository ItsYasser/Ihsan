# About the application
Giving and helping others is one of the best sensations in this world. , that is a great side of humanity , and our true values are defined not by what we have, but by what we give to others.
Volunteering could be one of the best things that we can do to help others, especially in this holy month where "الحسنة بعشر امثالها", where there are many poor people who are not able to make "Iftar",and others who cannot stay with their families because of occupations, studies, etc
